Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely.
Once I was seven years old.

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger.
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker.
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely.
Once I was eleven years old.

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely.
Once I was twenty years old.

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure.
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major.
I got my boys with me atleast those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later.
